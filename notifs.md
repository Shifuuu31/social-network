Certainly! Let's break down the **Notifications** part of the social network project into **clear functional requirements** and **implementation guidance**:

---

## üîî Notifications Breakdown

### üìå **General Requirements**

* Notifications must be visible **on every page** of the site.
* Notifications should be **different from private messages** (displayed and stored separately).
* They should be **real-time** (if possible), or appear as soon as relevant events occur.
* Each notification must be associated with the **recipient user** and should have a **read/unread** status.

---

### ‚úÖ **When to Notify a User**

You need to generate notifications for the following events:

#### 1. **Follow Request (Private Profile)**

* When someone sends a **follow request** to a user with a **private profile**.
* The private user must be notified and able to **accept/decline**.

**Example Notification Text:**
üì® "Alice has requested to follow you."

---

#### 2. **Group Invitation**

* When a user is **invited to a group**.
* The invited user must be notified to **accept/decline**.

**Example Notification Text:**
üë• "You‚Äôve been invited to join the group *Go Developers*."

---

#### 3. **Group Join Request (For Group Creator)**

* When a user **requests to join** a group.
* The **group creator** should be notified and decide to **accept/decline**.

**Example Notification Text:**
üë§ "Bob requested to join your group *React Fans*."

---

#### 4. **Group Event Created**

* When an event is created inside a group, **all group members** should be notified.

**Example Notification Text:**
üìÖ "A new event *Weekly Meetup* has been created in *Study Group*."

---

### üí° Optional (Extra Ideas)

You can enhance the experience with extra notifications:

* üîÑ When a **follow request is accepted**
* ‚úÖ When you are **added to a group**
* üí¨ When someone **comments on your post**
* ‚ù§Ô∏è When someone **likes your post** (if likes are implemented)

---

### üß± **Data Model Suggestion (SQLite Table)**

```sql
CREATE TABLE notifications (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL, -- recipient
    type TEXT NOT NULL,       -- e.g., 'follow_request', 'group_invite', etc.
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    read BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    reference_id INTEGER,     -- e.g., user_id, group_id, etc. (nullable, for linking)
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

---

### üß† **Backend Logic**

* On each trigger event (e.g., follow request, group invite), **insert a row** in `notifications` for the target user.
* Notifications can be **fetched via API** like `/api/notifications`.
* Provide a route to **mark them as read**, e.g., `POST /api/notifications/:id/read`.

---

### üåê **Frontend UI**

* Use a **notification icon/bell** in the header that shows a badge with the number of unread notifications.
* On click, show a **dropdown or page** with the list of notifications.
* Different icons/colors for each notification type (for clarity).
* A toggle to mark as read or clear notifications.

---

### üîå **Bonus: Real-Time with WebSockets**

* Use **WebSocket** to push new notifications to users in real-time.
* When the backend creates a notification, also send a WebSocket message to the recipient (if connected).
