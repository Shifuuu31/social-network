## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Backend Components
```
pkg/handlers/
â”œâ”€â”€ notifications.go     # Complete notification API
â”œâ”€â”€ hub.go              # WebSocket management  
â”œâ”€â”€ groups&members&events.go  # Group notification integration
â”œâ”€â”€ profile&follows.go  # Follow request notifications
â””â”€â”€ router.go           # WebSocket endpoint mounting
```

### Frontend Components
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ stores/notificationStore.js    # Pinia store
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ notifications.vue         # Notification dropdown
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Header.vue                # Header integration
â”œâ”€â”€ views/Notifications.vue       # Full notifications page
